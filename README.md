This project is a "technical automated" port of Fallout 2 as a Fallout 4 Mod. The main goal of this project is not to re-create a playable F2 game, but a research project on how this could be done with in an automated way, with an "automatic translation" of original scripts / assets / gameplay elements into the F4 engine. These scripts are NOT meant to fully work and won't ever build a real game. This is a fun, mostly useless, reasearch side project. 

If you want to try any of these, please read the "Do It Yourself" section. You'll need a copy of the Fallout 2 game (works with the steam release, should work with anything).
